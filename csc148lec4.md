## Abstract Data Types (ADTS)

- Abstraction: ignoring certain details to make problems easier to solve
- __Abstract__ because there is no mention of implementation details
- __Data Type__ because it includes data and operations on those
- Allows us to directly describe the data used in our problems, independent of implementation details
- In fact, you've worked with some ADTS
