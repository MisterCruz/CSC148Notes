# Tree Traversals

- Traversals: accessing each element of a structure
- We say we have visited an element when we have done something with it

1. Preorder - visit the root node, do a preorder traversal of the left subtree and do a preorder traversal of the right subtree

2. Inorder - Do an inorder traversal of the left subtree, visit the root node, and then do an inorder
traversal of the right node

3. Postorder
