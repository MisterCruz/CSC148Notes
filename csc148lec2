1. Function-based approach

```python
def sqrt(n):
  '''float -> float'''

```

- Functions make less sense when you have actors in your domain

```python
def eat_junk(person, food):

eat_junk('Dan', 'chips')

```

2. Object-oriented programming
- We model actors, not Functions

```python
class Person:
  def eat_junk(...):

dan = Person()
dan.eat_junk()
```
Strange notation for numbers:
```python
7.sqrt()
```

Python has a lot of objects already :tada: :
- string, list, tuple, float, dictionary...

But sometimes we want to model stuff that isn't built-in already.

To introduce a new type of object, we use a new class

You have to decide:
1. What can the new object do? Actions/Methods

```python
class Person:
  #Methods: walk, sleep, cry, eat, pass_CSC148, drive, brush_teeth, die
```

2. What does the object have? Attributes :sparkles:
- implemented using instance variables
- Think about its features

What are some Attributes for Person: hair color, eye color, height

3. What are interactions with other objects?
Often, someone gives you a spec for what your software should do. It's up to you to do an OO analysis of that spec

Find the classes, find methods, find Attributes, find object interactions

Once you do the analysis, then think about writing code

- Find classes by finding nouns in the specification

- Find methods by searching for verbs

- Find attributes by searching for minor nouns
